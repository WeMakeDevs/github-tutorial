# Community Classroom is OP

- Community Classroom motivate me for learning programming and contributing to open source.
- I have been doing this is a disciplined manner regularly inspite of my non-IT background and current job role in non-IT background as well.
- I am learning seriusly and hope the learning will compound and give me results.
